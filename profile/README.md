## What it is Sheepnap?

Sheepnap is a decentralized accommodation protocol where users can participate as hosts, guests, investors, or governance participants.

Hosts operate within the Sheepnap protocol through individual smart contracts, which encode and broadcast their property's availability and pricing data to the blockchain. Due to the transparent nature of blockchain records, these details are fully accessible and verifiable by anyone on the network.

Users may employ indexed services to query blockchain datasets for property specifics, enabling the comparison of availability and pricing. Subsequently, they can execute transactions to purchase and mint an ERC-721 compliant NFT, termed 'Booken,' which acts as a digital representation of their reservation.

Investors can engage with Sheepnap's unique staking feature, which offers a share in the revenue generated by properties. By allocating the Sheepnap's tokens into a property's staking pool, investors earn rewards that are directly proportional to their stake.  

Governance participants in the Sheepnap ecosystem play a pivotal role in steering the protocol's development and policies. These stakeholders engage through a structured governance framework, wielding the platform's native governance tokens to propose, debate, and vote on key decisions. Their contributions directly influence operational guidelines, feature implementations, and the strategic direction of the protocol. By actively participating in governance, these users ensure that Sheepnap remains aligned with the community's interests and evolves in response to its collective decision-making.

Sheepnap's protocol integrates smart contracts to facilitate a decentralized network for property management, stakeholder governance, and transaction processing. It ensures that accommodation booking, revenue sharing, and governance are seamlessly executed on the blockchain, providing a robust and transparent system for users and investors alike.

## Why Sheepnap

One of the problems that Sheepnap aims to solve is the lack of control and transparency service providers experience with traditional systems. By using blockchain technology, Sheepnap ensures that hosts and guests have full control over their bookings and the ability to set their own terms. Furthermore, the blockchain system provides total transparency, ensuring that all transactions are traceable and that arbitrary prioritization in search results is not an issue.

A crucial point is that Sheepnap tackles the interoperability and compatibility issues among different GDSs. With Sheepnap, hosts create property contracts that are standardized and compatible with other platforms that follow the same protocol. This means that a property contract created in Sheepnap can be listed on any other compatible platform, eliminating the barriers and complexity associated with managing multiple listings on different systems.

Traditional Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) operate on a centralized model, where substantial revenue from bookings is retained by the agencies, often leading to diminished earnings for property owners and higher costs for guests. Sheepnap, in contrast, introduces a decentralized approach, redistributing these earnings back to its community of users and property owners.


<!-- TOC --><a name="aims-for-full-decentralization"></a>
## Aims for Full Decentralization

Sheepnap aims to be a fully decentralized platform, leveraging the inherent benefits of blockchain technology. In line with this goal, all information related to pricing and availability is managed on-chain. This ensures a high level of transparency and control for hosts, as all data is publicly verifiable and cannot be tampered with.

Moreover, each listed property manages its own static information and metadata. This approach further emphasizes the decentralized nature of Sheepnap Protocol, allowing property owners to have full control over how they present their listings, and enabling them to update or modify this information without relying on a central authority.


By focusing on complete decentralization, Sheepnap aspires to set a new standard for trust and autonomy in the tourism industry, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries and central control points.


<!-- TOC --><a name="community-driven"></a>
## Community-driven

The Sheepnap community is committed to ensuring that all listed properties meet minimum requirements for generating Bookens. Additionally, the community actively resolves disputes between hosts and guests through a governance system and voting mechanisms.


<!-- TOC --><a name="what-are-bookens"></a>
## What are Bookens?

A Booken is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT ERC721) with an additional layer within the Sheepnap protocol, serving as a digital representation of a reserved accommodation stay. It encapsulates key information such as the reservation dates, property details, pricing, and host's terms. Uniquely transferable, a Booken can be freely exchanged, fostering the development of an ecosystem of investors and a dynamic marketplace in a way that only blockchain and the decentralized world can offer. The Booken transitions through various states, from initial reservation to confirmation, in-stay, completion, or cancellation by the host. It ensures a transparent, secure, and immutable record of the booking process, aligning with decentralized principles and leveraging blockchain technology for optimal trust, innovation, and efficiency.


<!-- TOC --><a name="what-are-dotas"></a>
## What are DOTAS?

DOTAs (Decentralized Online Travel Agencies) operate using blockchain technology with smart contracts serving as decentralized intermediaries between guests and hosts. In addition to automating the reservation flow and ensuring its proper execution, DOTAs may incorporate their own indexing systems to process property pricing and availability information. This provides users with a streamlined interface for comparing options and conducting detailed searches, akin to traditional platforms, yet with the transparency and efficiency that typifies decentralized solutions.

<!-- TOC --><a name="property-based-staking-pools"></a>
## Property-based Staking Pools

Unlike traditional staking methods, Sheepnap introduces a unique twist: each property listed on the platform serves as an individual staking pool. Wool Token holders can choose which property they wish to stake their tokens in. This adds an exciting layer of strategy and engagement, as token holders can decide to stake in properties they deem most valuable or promising.

<!-- TOC --><a name="host"></a>
# Host

Each property is represented on the blockchain by its own unique smart contract. As such, each host is required to deploy a separate contract for each of their properties. This contract is responsible for establishing the necessary boundaries and rules for the property to begin operations. Additionally, it stores a reference to the property's metadata information.

<!-- TOC --><a name="metadata"></a>
## Metadata

Each property owner is responsible for the maintenance and updating of the metadata associated with their property. This metadata must adhere to Sheepnap's protocol standards to ensure that it can be accurately interpreted by any DOTA (Decentralized Autonomous Travel Agent). Keeping metadata up-to-date is essential for the platform's smooth operation, as it impacts the property's visibility and the likelihood of it being selected by a user

<!-- TOC --><a name="pricing-and-availability-controllers"></a>
## Pricing and Availability Controllers

Pricing controllers are modular contracts that a host can choose based on their specific needs for their property's pricing model. This modularity and freedom of choice are important because pricing calculations can become complex and thus consume a significant amount of gas in various processes. These processes include registering pricing information and calculating costs over a range of dates and occupancy levels to create a reservation and generate a Booken. Generally, the less flexible a pricing controller is, the less gas it consumes. By default, Sheepnap comes with two initial pricing controllers that hosts can select for their property. 

Once selected, the pricing controller is integrated into the property contract. It is then utilized for registering and calculating both availability and pricing details
  
> It is important to note that upon on-chain pricing registration, all this information becomes public, making it accessible to any individual or entity looking into it.
    
<!-- TOC --><a name="bookens-flow"></a>
## Bookens Flow

Whenever a user seeks to book your property, they initiate a transaction with the Sheepnap contract. This activates the pricing controller within the property's contract to perform necessary calculations for determining the appropriate payment. The Sheepnap contract then facilitates the receipt of the corresponding funds, acting as an intermediary between the user and the property and serving as an escrow to ensure secure and transparent transactions between both parties. Subsequently, the property contract generates a Booken, embedding the relevant data, which is then issued to the Guest

Once the reservation is complete, the user can submit their review by burning the Booken associated with the reservation.

# Sheepnap DAO

The Sheepnap DAO contract is responsible for overseeing property approvals within the Sheepnap ecosystem. It acts as an intermediary between users and property contracts, streamlining the booking process. This contract also manages voting on proposals made by stakers, ensuring community-driven governance. Additionally, it handles the review and rating system for registered properties, maintaining a transparent and accountable feedback mechanism

<!-- TOC --><a name="sheepnap-property-approval-process"></a>
## Sheepnap Property Approval Process

As part of the property listing request, Sheepnap requires a registration fee from hosts. This fee is necessary for processing the listing application and serves as a commitment indicator from the host, ensuring that only serious and dedicated properties are submitted for approval.

The approval process is driven by Sheepnap's token holders, who participate in a DAO-based voting system. They review and vote on each property listing request, determining whether a property meets the standards and criteria set by the Sheepnap community.

A property is approved and listed on the platform only if it garners sufficient votes in favor, reflecting the community's confidence in the property’s quality and suitability.

### Sheepnap Reviews and Ratings System

The Sheepnap platform implements a comprehensive and robust reviews and ratings system, tailored to offer a decentralized, transparent, and accurate reflection of guest experiences. This system is structured around a set of specific categories, each weighted according to its relative importance in the overall guest experience. Below is a detailed outline of the system's design and functionality:

<!-- TOC --><a name="categories-and-weight-distribution"></a>
### Categories and Weight Distribution

- Cleanliness (20%): Assessing the hygienic standards and tidiness of the accommodation. This category is crucial as it directly impacts guest comfort and satisfaction.

- Comfort (15%): Evaluating the overall comfort level offered by the property, including the quality of furniture and sleeping arrangements.

- Location (15%): Rating the convenience and appeal of the property’s location, considering factors like accessibility, proximity to attractions, and neighborhood safety.

- Amenities and Facilities (10%): Focusing on the additional services provided, such as internet connectivity, kitchen utilities, laundry services, and other conveniences that enhance the stay.

- Value for Money (10%): Judging whether the stay was worth the price paid, balancing cost against the quality of services and amenities offered.

- Description Accuracy (10%): Ensuring that the property’s online description and images accurately represent the actual condition and offerings.

- Participation of the Host (5%): Reflecting how actively and constructively the host engages in the guest review process, contributing to the overall quality and reliability of the platform.

Each category is rated on a 1-to-5 scale, where 1 represents the lowest satisfaction and 5 the highest. The overall rating for a property is calculated using a weighted average algorithm, where each category's score is multiplied by its respective weight, and the sum of these products is then divided by the total sum of the weights. This methodology ensures that more crucial aspects like cleanliness and comfort have a greater impact on the final rating.

<!-- TOC --><a name="rating-system"></a>
# Rating System

Upon completion of their stay, guests are invited to submit a review through a blockchain-based system. This process involves the burning of their reservation's Booken NFT, which triggers the release of their initial deposit and unlocks the review submission interface. The submitted reviews, including both textual feedback and categorical ratings, are stored as IPFS hashes on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
